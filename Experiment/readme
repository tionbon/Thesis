Desired Probabilities (Input): 
[B = Black, W = White, M = Male, F = Female]
P(W) = .5
P(B) = .5
P(M) = .5
P(F) = .5
P(+) = .5
P(+|W) = .5
P(+|B) = .5
P(+|M) = .5
P(+|F) = .5
P(+|BF) = .16
P(+|WF) = .28
P(+|BM) = .28
P(+|WM) = .28

# probability distribution for education
edu = ["Masters","Bachelors","Highschool"]
P(edu) = {"Masters": .3, "Bachelors": .5, "Highschool": .2}
P(+|edu) = {"Masters": 0.8, "Bachelors": 0.55, "Highschool": 0.3}


# probability distribution for working 1 to 6 years
years = [i for i in range(1,7)]
P(year) = [.30,.25,.15,.15,.10,.05]
P(+|year) = {1: 0.15, 2: 0.3, 3: 0.5, 4: 0.6, 5: 0.7, 6: 0.8}

# probability distribution for getting 1 to 10 warning
warnings = [i for i in range(7)]
